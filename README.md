# 🚀 **Telco Customer Churn Analysis Project**

Welcome to the **Telco Customer Churn Analysis** project! 🎉 Ready to dive deep into the world of customer behavior and churn in the telecom industry? This project brings together powerful data analysis, SQL queries, and captivating visualizations to uncover the hidden patterns that drive customer attrition. Whether you're a data enthusiast, business analyst, or telecom professional, this repo is your ultimate guide to understanding and reducing churn. 📊

## 🤔 **What is Customer Churn?**

Customer churn is the term used when customers stop using a company's services. In the telecom industry, churn is a critical metric that directly impacts both revenue and customer lifetime value. 🚨 High churn rates signal potential problems in service quality, pricing, or customer satisfaction. This project will explore key factors influencing churn, like monthly charges, contract types, and service offerings, to help businesses create smarter retention strategies.
